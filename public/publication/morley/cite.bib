This study quantifies the shape of the first metacarpals9 body in the extant Homininae and some fossil hominins to provide insights about the possible anatomical correlates of manipulative capabilities. Materials and methods: The extant sample includes {MC}1s of modern humans (n=42), gorillas (n=27) and chimpanzees (n=30), whilst the fossil sample included \textit{Homo neanderthalensis}, \textit{Homo naledi} and \textit{Australopithecus sediba}. 3D geometric morphometrics were used to characterize the overall shape of {MC}19s body. Results: Humans differ significantly from extant great apes when comparing overall shape. \textit{H. neanderthalensis} mostly falls within the modern human range of variation although also showing a more robust morphology. \textit{H. naledi} varies from modern human slightly, whereas \textit{A. sediba} varies from humans to an even greater extent. When classified using a linear discriminant analysis, the three fossils are categorized within the \textit{Homo} group. Discussion: The results are in general agreement with previous studies on the morphology of the {MC}1. This study found that the modern human {MC}1 is characterized by a distinct suite of traits, not present to the same extent in the great apes, that are consistent with an ability to use forceful precision grip. This morphology was also found to align very closely with that of \textit{H. neanderthalensis}. \textit{H. naledi} shows a number of human-like adaptations consistent with an ability to employ enhanced manipulation, whilst \textit{A. sediba} apparently presents a mix of both derived and more primitive traits.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
