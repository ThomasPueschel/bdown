      <description>&lt;p&gt;##African palaeoecology##&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great number of unsolved palaeoenvironmental questions concerning hominins relate to their emergence during the Miocene and early radiation through the Pliocene. Understanding the relationship between ecosystem dynamics and hominin palaeobiology is fundamental to test hypotheses that attempt to elucidate the influence of the environment on the morphological and behavioural adaptations of early hominins. The mammalian fossil record offers critical evidence about the context of human evolution by providing comprehensive information on faunal change through time. The analysis of this outstanding fossil record can provide essential insights about the interaction of environmental change and mammalian evolution, including processes that likely affected hominin evolution. Hence, I am currently collaborating with different colleagues to better understand this key time periods. To develop this line of research I was recently awarded both a Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship and two Boise Funds for Palaeanthropological Research. I am currently working on the following sub-topic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;•	Development of new dental ecometrics to reconstruct the African late Miocene/early Pliocene environment:  As teeth are the most common mammalian remains found in the fossil record, many studies have used them as source of palaeoecological information. Among the promising approaches applied to interpreting palaeoclimate from dental remains, there is a method known as ‘dental ecometrics’. This refers to the study of tooth functional traits that have a relationship with climate or environmental gradients at the community level. This research will generate innovative automated ecometric models to reconstruct the paleoenvironments of the African late Miocene/earliest Pliocene using more complex 3D dental variables and machine-learning regression methods. I was awarded a Boise Fund grant to carry out this project, and I am applying for a Synthesis Access project in the following weeks, to strengthen my comparative sample.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New morpho-functional tools</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;##New tools to analyse primate form and function in an evolutionary framework##&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysing the correlation between form and ecological function is not only relevant to understanding the morphological diversity observed in extant species, but also because it allows us to infer past behaviours in palaeobiological contexts. Given the inherent difficulty of this topic, to elucidate the association between form and function in an ecological and evolutionary context it is necessary to coherently apply a combination of diverse methods, derived from several disciplines such as evolutionary biology, quantitative genetics, biomechanics, phylogenetic comparative techniques, multivariate statistics and ecology, among others. I am collaborating with different colleagues to develop tools and workflows in the following sub-topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;•	Combining finite element analysis (FEA), geometric morphometrics (GM) and phylogenetic comparative methods (PCMs): One of my long-standing methodological aims is to understand the relationship between form and ecological function in diverse skeletal elements belonging to different primate clades taking into account their phylogenetic relatedness and using state-of-the-art in silico techniques. My aim is to provide an understanding of the role of functional performance in the evolution of morphological form in different anthropoid groups and ascertain the influence of ecological function on skeletal morphology. Therefore, I have been developing different pipelines to combine GM to quantify shape, FEA to analyse function, and PCMs to contextualise the obtained results in an evolutionary and ecomorphological framework2,3,5,6,8–11. These workflows allow me to explicitly test hypotheses regarding the role of functional factors in the evolution of morphological diversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;•	New statistical tools to analyse FEA outputs: In computational biomechanics, FEA has become increasingly popular because of its ability to show the biomechanical behaviour of anatomical structures. The results obtained using FEA are commonly expressed as colour maps or as summary statistics, but they do not easily enable a quantitative performance comparison between similar structures, and do not fully exploit the results obtained from FEA. We have are developing different techniques to enable the quantitative comparison of FEA results from several specimens in a multivariate statistical framework12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;•	Taxonomic applications of machine-learning algorithms to analyse fragmentary palaeoanthropological materials: I have recently started a new collaboration to analyse Kenyan paleoanthropological fragmentary remains that although highly important, remain difficult to diagnose due to their fragmented nature. Hence, we have started to analyse these fossils using 3D morphometrics and a sophisticated battery of machine-learning classification algorithms in order to provide a taxonomic identity to these remains&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Primate morphology</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;##Primate evolutionary morphology##&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important part of my research has been devoted to the study of the key adaptations defining different stages of anthropoid evolution. I am interested in the selective pressures responsible for specific evolutionary transitions, in particular (but not limited to) the split between the lineages leading to humans and apes, and the adaptive radiation of New World monkeys. For some of this work I was awarded two scholarships by the Chilean National Research and Development Agency, as well as a European Synthesis Grant. This work can be further divided into the following topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;•	Adaptive radiation of New World monkeys: Platyrrhines are a diverse group of primates that presently occupy a broad range of tropical-equatorial environments in the Americas. I am particularly interested in the phenotypic adaptations, the main drivers of diversification, the role and importance of abiotic and biotic factors, and the processes that underlie the adaptive radiation of this highly diverse group, since their origin ~35-45 million years ago. I use 3D morphometrics and phylogenetic comparative analyses to identify major shifts in phenotypic evolution (in different anatomical structures) through time and to determine whether phenotypic shifts are synchronous with key geological, climatic or other environmental changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;•	Primate post-cranial adaptive evolution: As a result of the varying demands and constraints of the diverse ecological niches where primates live, their behaviours are congruently complex, plastic and diverse, which means that the relationship between a particular morphology and certain behaviour are not straightforward. Consequently, I want to understand the evolution of primate locomotor behaviours and their anatomical correlates, and how we can apply this knowledge to the fossil record. My research is hypothesis-driven and relies on an interdisciplinary approach that integrates experimental methods with traditional and state-of-the-art morphometrics, computational biomechanics, and may use data acquired from live animals, cadaveric materials, extant and fossil skeletons, and 3D imaging (e.g. CT data).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;•	The evolution of the ape and human hands: Inferring the locomotor behaviour of the last common ancestor (LCA) of African apes and humans is still a divisive subject. An African great-ape-like ancestor using knuckle-walking is the most parsimonious hypothesis for the LCA, despite diverse conflicting lines of evidence. Using morphometrics, computational biomechanics, and phylogenetic comparative methods, my colleagues and I have been working in modelling the evolution of human and ape hand morphology6,7. This is fundamental to understand the origins of the modern human hand and its precision grip capabilities, tool use, and the locomotor repertoire of the LCA.&lt;/p&gt;
