abstract: This systematic review and meta-analysis showed that symptoms of depression have a moderate association with symptom severity, function and pain after carpal tunnel release [CTR]. Symptoms of anxiety, catastrophic thinking, and self-efficacy are also important indicators of poor post-surgery outcomes. Physicians, physical therapists, and occupational therapists should consider evaluating these variables in patients undergoing CTR.
