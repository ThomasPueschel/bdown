abstract: The Mylodontidae family was once one of the most diverse Pleistocene fauna in South America. Within this family, the genus *Glossotherium* showed a wide distribution in the southern cone with a single record in Chile SGO.PV.2 housed at the National Museum of Natural History of Chile. Provided that the species allocation of this individual as *Glossotherium lettsomi* was made 48 years ago, a revision was carried out considering new taxonomic studies. Based on this recent information, a new diagnosis of the specimen was carried out. Principal component analyses (PCA) and a linear discriminant analyses (LDA) were performed using comparative cranial data obtained from the literature in order to establish initial morphological affinities. In addition, a phylogenetic inference analysis was conducted to establish the phylogenetic position of SGO.PV.2. Finally, the first description of the post-cranial skeleton of SGO.PV.2 is also provided. The results of the different analyzes performed in this study indicate that SGO.PV.2 should be assigned to the species *Glossotherium robustum*, thus currently representing the only record of this species in Chile.
