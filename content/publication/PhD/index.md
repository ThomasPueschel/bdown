abstract: The overarchingobjective of  this dissertation is to understand  the relationship betweenform  and  ecological  function  in diverse skeletal  elements belonging  to different primate clades using  geometric morphometrics (GM), finite element analysis (FEA) andphylogenetic comparative methods (PCMs). GM provides a system for quantifying  morphology; while FEA  allows measuring  biomechanical performance  and  PCMs  are  used  to  model  how  phenotypic  traits  have evolved through    time.    Most    chapters    in    this    thesis    focus    on    the association between  locomotion  and  morphology  and  how  to  apply  this information  in  the fossil  record,  while   one   analyses the  form–function relationship   in   a   dietary context.  Firstly, a combined  approach  using  FEA and  GM  is  applied  to  analyse different  hominoid scapulae.  The  obtained results  show  that  there  is  a  significant relationship  between scapularshape and  its  biomechanical  performance.  Hence  at least   part   of   scapular  shape   variation   is   due  to  non-phylogenetic   factors. Secondly,  it  is tested  whether  there  is  a  sclerocarpic  specialization  gradient  in the mandibular  morphology of pitheciids. The  results  show  that  there  is  indeed a relative  specialization  continuum  for   some   aspects   of   shape,   although the story   is   more   complex   from   a  biomechanical  perspective. Subsequently,  an analysis  of  the  phenetic  affinities  of  extant  platyrrhine tali  and  their  Miocene counterparts  is  carried  out  to  explain  the evolution  of  talar  shape  and  size  in platyrrhines.  The  results  suggest that  talar  shape  diversification  can  be  explained by   invoking   a   model representing   a   phylogenetic hypothesis  in  which  each platyrrhine  family occupied  a  separate  adaptive  optimum.  Moreover,  talar  size diversification can be characterised by a multidimensional niche model. Finally, the main  locomotor  mode  of  different  platyrrhine  fossils  is  inferred by  applying  a combination  of  GM,  FEA  and  machine-learning (ML)  classification  techniques. The   ML   algorithm   applied   to   both   biomechanical   and   morphometric data categorised   most   of   the   fossil   sample   as   arboreal   quadrupeds, which   is consistent   with   previous   studies.   Thus,   it   is   expected  to contribute   to   the understanding of the correlation between form and ecological function, which is not only  relevant  to  appreciate  the  morphological diversity in  extant  species,  but  also because it allows to infer past behaviours infossil taxa.
