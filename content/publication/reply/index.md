abstract: In their recent communication, Mongle et al. argue that there are several problems with our recent analysis. Here we show that none of our divergence-time estimates are contrary to the current palaeoanthropological evidence and the conclusions reached by Mongle et al. are not supported, as their results are almost identical to ours. Furthermore, we also show that some of their criticisms are based on either incorrect information and flawed interpretations of the available evidence.
