I am in the process of establishing a research group focused on the morphological innovation along the human lineage, primate phylogenetics and adaptive evolution, and the development of new tools to analyse primate form and function in an evolutionary framework. Stay tuned for more information!


â€¢	**Laboratory**: The lab will be devoted to the macroevolutionary study of the primate and human phenotypic evolution and its relationship with different ecological factors. The primary objective is to elucidate the evolutionary pathways that underlie present-day and past variation in the primate clade and investigate how anatomical changes in deep time relate to diversity, adaptation, and function. Key questions include: What are the underlying mechanisms explaining the evolution of key primate and human innovations? What factors drive diversity patterns in primates? Are certain species or traits more prone to evolutionary changes? What is the ecological importance of these morphological modifications? The empirical focus lies with traits that are of key relevance to understanding mammalian, primate, and human evolution. Core topics include the evolution of the primate musculo-skeletal system, phylogenetic comparative methods, ecomorphology, phylogenetics and biomechanics.
