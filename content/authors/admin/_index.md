bio: I am the Wendy James Associate Professor in Evolutionary Anthropology at the School of Anthropology and Museum Ethnography, University of Oxford, as well as Tutorial Fellow at St. Hugh’s College. My research mainly focuses on human, primate, and mammalian evolution by using a combination of phylogenetics, 3D morphometrics, virtual biomechanical techniques, computational simulations, statistical modelling, phylogenetic comparative methods, and fieldwork. I am in the process of establishing a research group focused on these topics, so if you are interested in joining my research group, downloading publications or discussing potential collaborations, please explore the website.
